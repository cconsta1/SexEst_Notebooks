DATA AVAILABILITY
=================

This document summarizes provenance and reuse guidance for the two primary datasets used by the SexEst notebooks and models.

Datasets
- Goldman Osteometric Data Set
  - Description: Postcranial metric measurements (upper limb, lower limb, pelvis), sex estimates, and age categories compiled by Dr. Benjamin Auerbach (2001–2003). Global sample, mostly preindustrial groups; ~1500 individuals from 59 locations.
  - Source / download: https://web.utk.edu/~auerbach/DATA.htm (follow the link to the Goldman dataset page).

- William W. Howells Craniometric Data Set
  - Description: Cranial linear measurements taken by Dr. William Howells (1965–1980). Global comparative sample; >2500 individuals from multiple populations.
  - Source / download: https://web.utk.edu/~auerbach/DATA.htm (follow the link to the Howells dataset page).

Hosting and redistribution
- These datasets are provided by Dr. Auerbach through the linked website. The dataset owners ask that you do NOT redistribute the files yourself — instead, direct users to download them from the official source.
- If you require an archival copy for reproducibility (e.g., a journal supplementary archive), obtain any required permissions and provide clear attribution and citation to the dataset owners and original collectors.

Citations and acknowledgement
- When using the SexEst notebooks or models built from these data, cite both the dataset (per instructions on the Auerbach pages) and the SexEst paper:
  - SexEst paper (model / method citation): DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/oa.3109
  - For dataset-specific citation formats, follow the citation guidance on the Auerbach dataset pages linked above.

Contact
- Questions about dataset hosting or reuse: contact Dr. B. Auerbach (contact info on the dataset pages).
