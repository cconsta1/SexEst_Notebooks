# Data analysis notebooks

In this directory you can find notebooks that can be used 
to analyze the Goldman and Howell data and produce the models
used in the SexEst [web application](http://sexest.cyi.ac.cy/).

You can of course modify these notebooks, examine how the models
perform using different hyperparameters, optimize the hyperparameters
using different cross-validation algorithms, etc.

It is reccommended that you use the [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/index.html) environment. The necessary libraries must also
be installed using the `conda` or `pip` commands.
